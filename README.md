# WIP A modern lightweight physics engine for the browser
### A minimalist 2D physics engine written and maintained with TypeScript and RxJS for games, graphs or any canvas interface

Work in Progress (Do not use for Production yet) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/code0wl/2d-physics-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/code0wl/2d-physics-engine)

This project is maintained using TypeScript and RxJS. 
Nice to know is the project your are including this library in does not need to include these dependencies, of course :).
The package will only contain TypeScript and RxJS as dependencies. To keep the code as light-weight as possible, I have decided to only make it work for modern browsers.
A full list of supported browsers will be up as soon as the project is complete.

**Module Support** 

Engine will support the following modules which could be seen as features

- Accelerometer
- RigidShape
- Gravity
- Collision
- Canvas Drawing interface
- Different input peripheral support (mouse, keyboard, leap-motion, VR)
